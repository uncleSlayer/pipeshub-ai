"""
Agent-specific fetch-full-record tool.

This is a dedicated tool for the QnA agent that mirrors exactly how the chatbot
handles full-record retrieval.  The chatbot flow is:

  1. LLM calls fetch_full_record with R-labels ("R1", "R2") or UUIDs.
  2. stream_llm_response_with_tools → execute_tool_calls runs the tool.
  3. The tool returns {"ok": True, "result_type": "rag", "records": [...]}.
     The "result_type" marker tells execute_tool_calls to route this result
     through the RAG envelope path (records/record_count/...) instead of the
     generic passthrough path used for MCP/other tools.
  4. execute_tool_calls calls record_to_message_content(record, final_results)
     on each raw record — producing formatted R-block text.
  5. Formatted text is placed into a ToolMessage for the LLM.

This agent tool follows the same contract so execute_tool_calls formats results
identically to the chatbot, giving the LLM properly R-labelled block content.

Key differences from the raw fetch_full_record tool (fetch_full_record.py):
  - This file is agent-only — it never touches chatbot code.
  - It accepts an explicit final_results list for consistent record numbering.
  - R-label resolution uses the same logic as the chatbot mapping.
